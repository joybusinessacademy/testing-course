            Let’s take a closer look at Mainfreight’s Owner-Driver model

        <button-row align="center">
            <modal :content="modal">
                <p>Trucks are owned exclusively by “Owner-Drivers” who contract to Mainfreight and uphold the culture and standards set by Mainfreight. This model provides ownership and accountability for customer freight during all Domestic Transport processes.</p>

            <modal :content="modal2">
                <p>It’s a win/win as Owner Drivers get to own and run their own business alongside a global company. Drivers get paid per delivery and pickup based on the distance of travel and size of freight.</p>

                <p>Mainfreight has less capital outlay in purchasing of trucks and reduced operating expense maintaining the fleet. Owners take pride in their vehicles and keeping “their” customers happy.</p>
