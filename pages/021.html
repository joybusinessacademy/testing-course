            Loading a truck is not as simple as filling it to capacity. We have to consider the weight and density of products that are being loaded to make sure the truck is balanced and that product does not get damaged. To ulitise a trucks capacity freight needs to be a mixture of different types of product so we can satisfy these requirements.
